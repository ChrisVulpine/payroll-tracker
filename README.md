# Payroll Tracker

## Description

This was a project designed to create a payroll tracking system. Using prompts, an employer can enter each employee's name and salary. The information is then presented in a table sorted by last name. It is also able to display the average salary of all employees and generate a random employee in the console. I built this project as a means to practice JavaScript. I learned more basic JavaScript functions as well as the map and reduce functions. Overall I am happy with how this project turned out.

This project is meant to be used in the browser here: https://chrisvulpine.github.io/payroll-tracker/

## Usage

The user upon pressing the "Add Employees" button will be given window prompts to add the following employee information: first name, last name, and salary. Then a choice will appear to add another employee. Once the user is finished, they will press "Cancel" at the last prompt. Employees will then be displayed in a table sorted by last name with the above information displayed. When bringing up the console, users will be able to see the average of the salaries as well as see a random employee chosen.
